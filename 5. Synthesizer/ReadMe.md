# PWM Synthesizer

This project uses a hardware ISR timer to implement a synthsizer by controlling the duty cycle of a voltage signal pulse to an audio output. 
This project receives note input by scanning a 4x4 button array where each one is assigned a pitch frequency by being assigned a pwm duty cycle.
The demo of this project can be observed here:
