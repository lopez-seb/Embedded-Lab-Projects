# PWM applied to LED brightness from Keypad input

This lab changes the brightness of the onboard LED based on input from a connected keypad. Each button is assigned a duty cycle and is applied to the LED. 
Project is implemented using 2 hardware timers: one to controll the brightness of the LED by changing the duty cycle of the signal sent to it, and anoter to periodically scan the keypad for input.
A demonstration of the project can be observed here:
